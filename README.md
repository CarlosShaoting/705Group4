# CS705 Group Project
## VR and Psychophysiological Performance
We try to explore the relationship between humans' psychophysiological data (heart rate, pupil size) and reaction time during the driving simulator.

## Experiment Tasks

Participants will be asked to drive in the VR simulator, and we will generate some random events and obstacles.

## Data We Collect

We will collect participants' pupil size through the Vive VR headset, and the heart rate through the Polar OH1 worn on their arm.

## Script

### Greeting

Hello everyone, in this experiment you will wear the VR headset and play a driving game on the driving simulator. We will collect your heart rate through the Polar sensor. During the experiment, you will need to dodge the obstacles as much as you can. If you feel dizzy, please tell us and stop the experiment.

### Informed Consent

We will print an informed consent document, and if the participant accepts the document and signs it, then we will collect the data from them.

### Exact Task

Participants do not have to do anything special but drive the car normally on the road and dodge the generated pedestrians.

## Static Analysis

Download the `requirements.txt` for the Python packages.  
Download the heart rate data from:  
[Polar Flow Diary](https://flow.polar.com/diary/training-list)  
The pupil size and reaction time data are stored in the game log file, generated by each Unity program.  
In the `data_processing.ipynb` file, change the file name to the datasets you want to analyze (experiment log and heart rate data). The program will perform a linear regression based on X (reaction time) and Y (heart rate or pupil size).  
The first block of Python code will draw the heart rate graph.  
The second block of code will calculate the heart rate variability, based on the event time and an interval used to calculate the HRV (due to the delay of the sensor, we could try different intervals on the same dataset and check the difference).  
The last block draws the scatter plot of HRV vs. Reaction Time and HRV vs. Pupil Size. It uses the Pearson function to check the linear relationship and the Spearman function to check the nonlinear relationship between those two datasets.
